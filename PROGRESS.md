## Completed Features

### Minor Fixes Batch (2026-06-16)
- **ClientFile closed-client badges** — `ClientFile.jsx` header now mirrors `ClientRow`'s "gray everything when relieved_closed" logic: custody badge (`In Custody`/`Bonded Out`/`Out`) renders with `badgeGray` instead of red/green when `relieved_closed = true`, and a `CLOSED` badge now appears next to it. Added `.badgeGray`, `.badgeStack`, `.closedBadge` classes to `ClientFile.module.css` (copied from `ClientRow.module.css`) — previously these existed only in `ClientRow`, so the single client view never reflected closed status.
- **`charge_abbrev` on case creation** — the inline "+ add a case" form (`AddCaseForm` in `ClientFile.jsx`, used under an incident) now has an "Abbrev. (for client list)" input writing to `cases.charge_abbrev`, matching the field already present in `CaseView`'s edit form. Previously cases created from `ClientFile` had no way to set this field until edited from `CaseView`.
- **Sticky client name bar** — `ClientFile.jsx` renders a minimal `position: sticky; top: 0` bar showing `LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME (gender, age)` above the existing header, background `#1E2A3A` matching the page so it blends in; truncates with ellipsis on overflow. Stays visible while scrolling so the client identity is never ambiguous mid-scroll. New `.stickyNameBar` class in `ClientFile.module.css`.
- **Indigent circle mobile overflow fix** — added a `@media (max-width: 768px)` block to `ClientFile.module.css` truncating `.name` (`overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; min-width: 0`) so unusually long names (e.g. "Woods-James, Kimberly") can't push the indigent status circle out of the flex row on mobile. `IndigentCircle`'s container already had `flexShrink: 0`, so it stays anchored once the name truncates. Desktop layout (no media query match) and normal-length names are unaffected.

### UI Polish (2026-06-10)
- **Indigent status circle** — new `indigent_status text DEFAULT 'gray'` column on `clients` table; Dexie schema bumped to version 2 with `indigent_status` indexed; 14px visible dot inside a 28px transparent hit-area container (`display: inline-flex`, centered); pointer events on the outer container only — inner circle has `pointer-events: none`; cycles gray → red → green → gray on tap; offline-first writes via Dexie + `addToSyncQueue`; renders in `ClientRow` (to the right of the OCA number) and `ClientFile` header (line 1, after name/gender/age); both views stay in sync via `useLiveQuery`
- **ClientFile header layout** — `nameCore` (`LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME (gender, age)`) and indigent circle on line 1 as `flex-wrap: nowrap`; OCA number on its own line 2 in muted text (`#9faab8`, `0.85em`) — previously OCA was concatenated into the name string
- **Mobile custody badge** — font-size, padding, and border-radius all reduced 30% on mobile only (inside `@media (max-width: 768px)`); vertically centered against full row height via `position: absolute` on `.right` with `top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%)`; `.row` gets `position: relative` and `padding-right: 76px` to keep content clear — desktop layout unchanged
- **Incident edit calendar overlap fix** — date `<input>` moved below description `<textarea>` in the incident inline edit form so the native mobile date picker no longer covers the description field; `autoFocus` moved to the textarea
- **Case number tap target tightened** — navigation handler moved from the full `caseTableRow` div onto the `caseNum` span only; charge/abbreviation text and surrounding whitespace no longer trigger case navigation; case table layout switched from CSS grid (`display: contents` rows) to flexbox column so row containers can carry `padding: 1px 0` — both columns share equal vertical breathing room and sit on the same baseline per row; `caseNum` span has `width: 56px; flex-shrink: 0` to preserve column alignment

### Offline Layer — Phase 2 + Text Viewer (2026-06-10)
- **Reads migrated to Dexie** — `useClients` and `useClientFile` rewritten to use `useLiveQuery` from `dexie-react-hooks`; app loads instantly from IndexedDB; UI auto-updates on any Dexie write; return shapes identical so no UI component changes were needed
- **All writes offline-first** — every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE across `NewClient`, `EditClient`, `ClientFile`, and `CaseView` writes to Dexie first then enqueues via `addToSyncQueue`; Supabase sync happens in the background; Storage uploads (warrants, criminal history, courtroom docs) remain direct
- **`CaseView` initial load from Dexie** — replaced Supabase `useEffect` fetch with a single `useLiveQuery` that reads the case record, walks `incident → client` for the header name, and covers all case fields including `notes` and `warrant_text`
- **`warrant_url` stores storage path** — warrant uploads now store `warrants/[case_number].pdf` in Dexie and Supabase instead of an expiring signed URL; "View Affidavit" generates a fresh signed URL on demand via `createSignedUrl`, matching how courtroom documents work
- **fullSync correctness** — `fullSync` calls `processSyncQueue` first so pending writes reach Supabase before the clear+bulkPut; after repopulating all 7 tables, re-applies any remaining pending queue entries to Dexie so local writes that haven't synced yet are never wiped from the UI; each table's clear+bulkPut is wrapped in a Dexie transaction
- **Deletions propagate across devices** — `fullSync` uses `clear()` + `bulkPut()` instead of `bulkPut` only, so records deleted on one device are removed from Dexie on all other devices at next sync
- **`processSyncQueue` hardened** — INSERT uses `upsert`, UPDATE uses `.update(payload).eq('id')` (avoids partial-payload upsert ambiguity); failures log `console.error('[syncQueue] failed:', table, operation, error)` for visibility during testing
- **TextViewerDrawer** — slide-up drawer component (`position: fixed`, 85% height, `0.28s cubic-bezier` transition, semi-transparent overlay) wired into: CaseView (`warrant_text`), ClientFile criminal history (`criminal_history_text`), ClientFile courtroom document tiles (`extracted_text`); typography: system-ui 13px, line-height 1.7, `#d0d8e4`, `pre-wrap`; fully offline since text is cached in Dexie

### Offline Layer — Phase 1 (2026-06-10)
- **Dexie.js** installed; `src/localDB.js` defines IndexedDB schema mirroring all 7 Supabase data tables plus a `sync_queue` table (auto-increment PK, fields: table_name, operation, record_id, payload, status, created_at, retry_count)
- **`src/syncManager.js`** exports: `fullSync` (parallel-fetches all tables → bulk-puts to Dexie, stamps `lastSyncedAt` in localStorage), `processSyncQueue` (processes pending queue entries oldest-first, upsert/delete via Supabase, retries up to 3×, marks failed after), `addToSyncQueue` (enqueues a local write), `startBackgroundSync` (30s interval + window `online` event → returns cleanup fn)
- **`src/SyncContext.jsx`** provides `isOnline`, `isSyncing`, `lastSyncedAt`, `triggerSync` via React context; initial `fullSync` fires on mount only after confirmed auth session; background sync starts after initial sync and is cleaned up on unmount
- **`App.jsx`** wraps router in `<SyncProvider>` inside `<AuthProvider>`
- **Sync status indicator** added to `ClientList.jsx` below the top bar: green dot + "Synced [time]" (online+synced), yellow dot + "Offline — changes will sync when reconnected" (offline), pulsing blue dot + "Syncing…" (in progress)
- All existing Supabase reads/writes untouched — Phase 1 is infrastructure only

### DB Cleanup (2026-06-09)
- Dropped `warrant_status` column from `cases` (was ignored by UI)
- Dropped `da_name` column from `cases` (legacy, no longer shown)
- Dropped `criminal_history` text column from `clients` (legacy, unused)
- Deleted `src/data/clients.js`, `src/data/cases.js`, `src/data/index.js` (static files, never used in UI)
- Removed unused `EditIncidentForm` component from `ClientFile.jsx` (inline editing replaced it)
- **Bug fix:** `useClientFile.js` nested `cases` select still included `da_name` after the column was dropped — Supabase errored silently, `incidentData` resolved to `null`, and all incidents disappeared from the Client File view. Fixed by removing `da_name` from the select.

### Deployment
- **Production URL:** `https://general-sessions-app.vercel.app` — auto-deploys on every push to `main`
- **GitHub repo:** `ladcock345324/general-sessions-app` — Vercel is connected to this repo/branch
- **vercel.json** — SPA rewrite rule (all paths → `/index.html`) + explicit cache-control headers:
  - `index.html` → `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` (always fetches latest)
  - `/assets/*` → `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (hashed filenames, safe to cache forever)
- **Supabase credentials** are hardcoded in `src/supabaseClient.js` — no env vars needed in Vercel
- ⚠️ Preview URLs (containing a hash segment like `4jtwv04l6` in the hostname) are **immutable snapshots** of a specific deployment — never use these for testing current changes; always use the production URL above

### Authentication
- Login page at `/login` — email/password via `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
- All routes protected by `RequireAuth` — redirects to `/login` if no session
- "Sign out" button in top-right corner of client list
- Session persists via `onAuthStateChange`

### Client List (`/`)
- Fetches all clients from Supabase via `useClients` hook
- Two sections: **Active** (`relieved_as_counsel = false`) and **Relieved as Counsel** (`true`)
- Both sorted alphabetically by last name
- Each section header shows a count badge (e.g. "Active 12")
- Each row shows: name, next hearing (blue), case numbers + charge abbrevs, custody badge
- **Case table** in each row: flexbox column of rows (`caseNum` fixed at `56px`, charge takes remaining space), `position: absolute` right-anchored so all case number left edges are flush; charge_abbrev shown if set, falls back to charge
- Badge colors: **In Custody** → muted crimson (`#b85555`); **Bonded Out** / **Out** → muted green (`#3d9e6a`); **CLOSED** / relieved clients → gray
- Active clients with `relieved_closed = true` show all custody badges in gray (same as CLOSED badge)
- `+` button top-right → Add Client form
- **Mobile layout** (`max-width: 768px`): 3-line stacked layout — name, next event, case table + badge on same line. Desktop layout unchanged.

### Add Client (`/client/new`)
- Fields: Last Name, First Name, Gender, Age, OCA #, Custody Status (In Custody / Bonded Out / Out), DA Name
- Inserts into `clients` table, redirects to client list

### Client File (`/client/:id`)
- **Header:** full name, custody badge, Total Bond (summed from all associated cases), DA name
- **Back button** navigates directly to `/` (not history-based)
- **Edit button** navigates to `/client/:id/edit`
- **Next Event block** (blue `#1E3A5F`): "NEXT EVENT" label + Edit button integrated into blue block
  - Docket type, reason (if set), date/time, courtroom (prefixed "Courtroom"), judge
  - **Clear button** in the edit form — deletes the `next_events` row for this client, returns block to empty state
- **Personal Notes** section (between Next Event and Incidents): single bar that shows the note inline or a muted "Add a personal note…" placeholder; tap to edit, Save/Cancel/Delete controls; one note per client stored in `personal_notes` table
- **Incidents** section:
  - Collapsible accordion — each incident shows "Description (Date)" header row
  - Sorted most recent first; case numbers within each incident sorted ascending
  - Inline editing: tap "edit incident" → description textarea (3 rows) and date become editable; save on blur or Enter; Escape cancels
  - `+` icon button on section header bar opens inline Add Incident form
  - Each expanded incident shows case rows + "+ add a case" at bottom
  - Case rows link to `/case/:caseNumber`
- **Hours** table: date, hours (green), description, × delete button per row
  - Running total at bottom
  - `+` button opens inline form (date defaults to today, hours dropdown 0.1–0.9)
  - Saves to Supabase, sorted most recent first
- **Section headers** (Incidents, Hours, Personal Notes, Criminal History, Courtroom Documents) use inline styles (`background: #0f1820`)
- **Criminal History** section: Upload/Replace/View Criminal History PDF; drag-and-drop supported
- **Courtroom Documents** section: up to 5 documents; rename/delete per document; tappable tiles open via signed URL
- **Edit Client** button → Edit Client form
- **Close Case / Relieve as Counsel / Reopen Case / Delete Client** action buttons

### Edit Client (`/client/:id/edit`)
- Pre-populated with live Supabase data
- Save uses `navigate('/client/:id', { replace: true })` — edit page is replaced in history, so Back from client file returns to client list

### Next Event Block
- Display format: `Jail Docket  |  Thursday 7/16/2026  |  9:00 AM`
- Weekday derived from `event_date` via `new Date()` + `toLocaleDateString`
- Time is optional — omitted from display if blank
- **Clear button** in edit form deletes the record entirely

### Case View (`/case/:caseNumber`)
- Header shows client name (`LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME`) centered between Back and Edit buttons
- **Upload Affidavit** / **Replace Affidavit** — drag-and-drop or tap; uploads PDF to Supabase Storage; "Replace Affidavit" button resized to match "View Affidavit" and "View Text" buttons
- **View Affidavit** button when affidavit is on file
- **Notes** textarea with Save/Saved confirmation
- **Disposition**, **Edit** (inline form includes `charge_abbrev` field), **Delete Case**

### Incident Editing
- Date input constrained to `max-width: 160px`
- Description uses `<textarea rows={3}>` — fully visible while editing
- Edit inputs stacked vertically (`flex-direction: column`)
- Hanging indent on two-line descriptions: `padding-left: 1.62em; text-indent: -1.62em`

### Custody Status
- Three options: `in_custody`, `bonded_out`, `out`
- "Out" badge styled identically to "Bonded Out" (muted green)
- All badges muted from original bright colors

### charge_abbrev
- `cases` table has `charge_abbrev text` column (added via `ALTER TABLE cases ADD COLUMN charge_abbrev text`)
- Editable in the case edit form in CaseView
- Client list shows `charge_abbrev` if set, falls back to `charge`

### Total Bond
- Computed in ClientFile as sum of `bond_amount` across all cases associated with the client
- Labeled "Total Bond:" in the client header
- `bond_amount` field removed from Edit Client and New Client forms

### Touch / Long-Press Handling
- All tappable navigation rows (client rows, case number rows, incident case rows) use a long-press-aware `tapHandlers` helper
- Touch hold ≥ 300ms suppresses navigation and allows native browser text selection
- Desktop mouse behavior completely unchanged

## Claude Integration

### Supabase MCP
- The Supabase MCP connector is connected to Claude chat (claude.ai) — Claude can directly query all database tables and read client data by asking natural language questions (e.g. "list all in-custody clients", "show warrant text for case GS1041482")
- No additional setup needed; MCP reads from the same Supabase project (`afhzkqjrciyoeizrpaxt`)

### PDF Text Extraction
- Fully implemented and working across all three upload types: warrant PDFs, criminal history PDFs, and courtroom documents
- **New database columns:**
  - `warrant_text` (text) on `cases` table
  - `criminal_history_text` (text) on `clients` table
  - `extracted_text` (text) on `courtroom_documents` table
  - Migration SQL: `supabase_migration_pdf_text.sql` in repo root
- **New utility:** `src/extractPdfText.js` — uses pdfjs-dist v6 with a CDN-hosted worker from `unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@6.0.227/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs` to extract text from PDF ArrayBuffers. cdnjs does not yet carry pdfjs-dist v6.x.
- **Upload handlers updated:**
  - Warrant upload in `CaseView.jsx` → writes to `cases.warrant_text`
  - Criminal history upload in `ClientFile.jsx` → writes to `clients.criminal_history_text`
  - Courtroom document upload in `ClientFile.jsx` → writes to `courtroom_documents.extracted_text`
- Text extraction fires automatically on every new PDF upload as a fire-and-forget operation after the storage upload and primary URL update succeed — never blocks or errors the upload itself
- **Key bug fixed:** Supabase JS v2's `PostgrestFilterBuilder` is lazy — the HTTP request only fires when the Promise is `await`ed. All three PATCH calls were inside non-`async` `.then()` callbacks, so the query builders were constructed and garbage-collected without ever sending a request. Fix: make each `.then()` callback `async` and `await` the Supabase call.

## Coming Next

### Features
- **Automation layer** — recurring tasks, reminders, or hooks (e.g. auto-notify before hearing dates)
- **RLS policies** — enable Row Level Security on all tables once auth is stable

### Known Issues / Things to Revisit
- Incident date sorting uses `new Date(incident_date)` which is fragile for non-standard date strings — acceptable while dates are entered via the auto-format field
- No pagination — all clients/cases load at once; fine for current scale
- All PDFs uploaded before the offline layer session have `null` text columns (`warrant_text`, `criminal_history_text`, `extracted_text`) — being resolved manually by re-uploading each PDF; not a code issue
- Sync status indicator not showing on iPhone PWA (cosmetic — indicator renders but may be hidden behind safe area or PWA chrome)
